/**
 * Freshness signal pulled from git commit history rather than a
 * manually-bumped frontmatter field — the date of the most recent
 * commit that actually touched this file. Returns null if the file has
 * no commit history yet (freshly added, uncommitted) — callers should
 * render nothing in that case, not a fallback date. Ported verbatim
 * from bytetech247.com.
 *
 * Requires full git history to be available (CI's checkout step must
 * use fetch-depth: 0 — a shallow clone can only see whichever commits
 * it happened to fetch, silently returning null for files last touched
 * further back than that).
