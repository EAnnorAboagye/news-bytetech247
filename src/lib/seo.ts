 * Composes a page's rendered <title> (also reused verbatim for

 * optional " — suffix". content.config.ts caps a post's raw title at 60
 * chars specifically so Google doesn't truncate it in search snippets —
 * but that schema check only ever sees the raw title, not the final
 * string a template renders once a category/site suffix is appended, so
 * a title that's valid on its own could still push the actual <title>
 * tag past the same budget it was capped to respect. Dropping the
 * suffix once the combination would exceed maxLength keeps the real,
 * truncatable string in-budget without forcing every post's title
 * shorter than it needs to be standalone. Ported verbatim from
 * bytetech247.com.
